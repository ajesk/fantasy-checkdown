# Fantasy Checkdown Chart

A general tool for tracking your draft tiers to be able to pick the most ideal players at each stage of the draft.

## Purpose

Created this tool for myself. Published it for whoever wants to use it :)

## Usage

### Local setup

To run this locally run first pull the repo (...duh...) then the following commands:

* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`

### Actual usage

Go download the draft tier list (`.csv`) from FantasyPros and either copy the contents of that CSV into the initial text box or upload the `.csv` directly to the site. Click import and your generated tier checkdown list should pop up!

For more details on how to use the service click on the hamburger menu that will give a detailed usage guide.
